/Note: I didn't call it "first post"/

This is an experimental weblog built with [[https://emacs.love/weblorg/][weblorg]].  Weblorg is a
static web site generator written entirely in emacs, using org-mode
files.  I have tried several other org-mode -> blog packages with
limited success.

This one seems to be the simplest to configure for use on github.io.
Not a lot of documentation yet, but it includes a sample that got me
over the hump.

Not a lot of features yet, but it does handle *RSS*.  It does not have
support for *tags*, but I probably wouldn't post enough to make actual
use of them.
